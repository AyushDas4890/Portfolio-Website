# How to add these READMEs to your repos

For each project below, copy the files into that repo's root and commit. Takes ~30 seconds each.

## ⚖️ Legal-Conflict-Resolver
1. Copy `legal-conflict-resolver/README.md` → repo root (replaces existing `README.md`).
2. Copy the `legal-conflict-resolver/assets/` folder → repo root (so `assets/banner.svg` exists).
3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add README.md assets/banner.svg
   git commit -m "docs: modern README with banner + architecture diagram"
   git push
   ```

## 🛒 Grocery-sales-predictor
Same steps with the `grocery-sales-predictor/` files.
> Note: this repo already has a `banner.png`. The new README points at `assets/banner.svg`; keep both or delete the old PNG — your call.

## 🎵 Instant-music-recommendation-system-using-Machine-Learning
Same steps with the `instant-music-recommendation/` files.
- Also copy the included **`requirements.txt`** (the repo didn't have one).
- The app reads `Top 100 most Streamed - Sheet1.csv` — make sure that CSV is committed (it may currently be git-ignored).

### Adding a screenshot (optional, makes it pop)
1. Run the app locally, take a screenshot.
2. Save it as `assets/app.png` in the repo.
3. The README already has a commented placeholder — just uncomment/adjust the image line.

### Want me to push these for you?
I can commit them directly if you connect the **GitHub** connector with write access — just say the word.
